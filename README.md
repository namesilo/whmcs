NameSilo's WHMCS 7.x Registrar Module

Installing the NameSilo module for WHMCS is easy and only takes a few minutes. This module allows WHMCS to
interface with NameSilo’s API to provide Registration, Transfer, Renewal, EPP Authcodes, DNS management and
domain updates to be processed in real-time. In addition, we have included a script to sync Expiry and Due Dates
for domains to ensure even if something changes outside of WHMCS that it will remain up-to-date.



TO INSTALL THE MODULE:

1. Upload the “namesilo” folder to your WHMCS Registrar Modules Directory with a standard FTP client.
(e.g. http://www.yourdomain.com/whmcs/modules/registrars/namesilo)

2. Log in to WHMCS, under "Setup" click on "Domain Registrars" select “NameSilo” from the list.

3. Fill in the details. *NOTE: Only your live API key is required. All other fields are optional at this time



TO UPGRADE THE MODULE:

1. Upload and overwrite the existing “namesilo” folder in your WHMCS Registrar Modules Directory with a
standard FTP client (e.g. http://www.yourdomain.com/whmcs/modules/registrars/namesilo).

2. Log in to WHMCS and under "Setup" click on "Domain Registrars" select "NameSilo" from the list.

3. Update any details that are still blank.
